# Contributing to Crest

Thank you for thinking of contributing to the project and taking the time to
read this document first! We want the library to constantly evolve and take
care of the common tasks encountered when creating RESTful services.

# Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/). By participating
you are expected to uphold this code.

# How Can I Contribute?

Any help is appreciated - from new features, bug fixes, documentation
improvements, example use cases etc. Just have a look at 
[the issues](https://github.com/samcragg/crest/issues) first to see if it's
already been suggested/reported and, if not, create
[an issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) to get some feedback.

# Coding Standards

The Visual Studio editor guidelines are included in the project and
[StyleCop](https://github.com/StyleCop/StyleCop) is used to create a consistent
look to the files, however, as long as it builds and has some unit tests
proving it works, the code can be tweaked after the Pull Request to make it fit
in with the rest of the code base as required.
